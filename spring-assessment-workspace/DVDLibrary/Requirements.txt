Overview
The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate your proficiency in 
basic Java syntax involving 
console input and output, 
basic file input and output, 
basic string/text manipulation, 
flow of control statements, 
expressions, and 
basic data structures such as arrays, Lists, and Maps. 
Additionally, you will demonstrate your proficiency in implementing the MVC design pattern and dependency injection.

Requirements
In this exercise, you will create a program that stores information about a DVD collection. The program must do the following:

1. Allow the user to add a DVD to the collection
2. Allow the user to remove a DVD from the collection
3. Allow the user to edit the information for an existing DVD in the collection
4. Allow the user to list the DVDs in the collection
5. Allow the user to display the information for a particular DVD
6. Allow the user to search for a DVD by title
7. Load the DVD library from a file
8. Save the DVD library back to the file when the program completes
9.Allow the user to add, edit, or delete many DVDs in one session

Additionally, the program must follow the MVC design pattern and use dependency injection as shown in the course material.

You should follow the process outlined in the Agile Approach Checklist for Console Applications document elsewhere in this course.

Your DVD data transfer object (dto) should have the following fields:

1. Title
2. Release date
3. MPAA rating
4. Director's name
5. Studio
6. User rating or note (allows the user to enter additional information, e.g., "Good family movie")
